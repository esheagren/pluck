# Bidirectional Cards (Definitions & Examples)

When the source text contains a definition or concept-example relationship, generate cards in both directions.

**For definitions:**
1. Blank the term → recall from definition
2. Blank the definition → recall from term

**For examples:**
1. "What is a typical example of X?" → Y
2. "Y is a typical example of ___" → X

This ensures recall works in both directions. Handled at the API prompt level.
