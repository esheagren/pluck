# Canonical Diagram Study Sets

For taxonomic, comparative, or structural knowledge (e.g., ML algorithm types, system architectures, process flows), allow users to generate a high-quality canonical diagram that serves as the reference for multiple related flashcards.

## User Story

1. User highlights text (e.g., a passage comparing ML approaches)
2. User explicitly chooses "Diagram mode" via toggle or button in the panel
3. System generates the canonical diagram first
4. User previews the diagram, can regenerate if needed
5. Once satisfied, user triggers "Generate questions from this"
6. System generates 4-6 questions that reference the diagram
7. User selects which questions to keep
8. Each saved card includes the diagram image

## Why It Matters

Some knowledge is inherently structural - the spatial relationships encode meaning that text cards lose. The diagram becomes a mental map that each card review reinforces. Two-step confirmation (diagram → then questions) avoids wasted effort if the diagram misses the mark.
