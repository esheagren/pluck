# Pluckk Roadmap

> **Note:** This is an icebox/parking lot of feature ideas. Items are not prioritized and may or may not be implemented.

---

## Study Sessions & Gamification

### Session Timer
A timer-based study mode where users start a focused session. Sessions can be completed either by finishing all due reviews for the day or by reaching a set time limit.

### User Profile & Activity Grid
A GitHub-style contribution grid showing review history. Each day displays whether reviews were completed and the number of questions answered. Provides a visual representation of consistency over time.

### Reminders
Configurable reminder system that triggers based on user behavior. For example, receive a reminder if you skip two consecutive days of reviews.

---

## Social Features

### Follow Other Accounts
Follow friends or other users to see their review activity. A leaderboard or activity feed could show who has completed their daily reviews.

### Kudos
Give recognition to users who have finished their reviews for the day. A lightweight way to encourage consistency in your network.

### Nudge
Send a gentle reminder email to friends who haven't reviewed in a while. The recipient would see something like "Erik has nudged you to do your reviews."

## Card Creation & Import

### Bulk Card Generation (Deep Research)
Generate a large set of cards about a subject or topic using a deep research query. Users would then curate and select which generated cards to keep.

### Anki Deck Import
Import existing Anki decks to migrate flashcard collections into Pluckk.

### Non-DOM Content Extraction
Extract text from sources outside the browser DOM, such as PDFs, or web views where content isn't accessible via standard DOM manipulation.

---

## Rich Content Support

### Media File Support
Support for various file types in cards including audio clips, images, and visual diagrams.

### LaTeX / Mathematical Notation
Render mathematical expressions and equations using LaTeX syntax.

### Diagram Generation
Premium option to generate high-quality diagrams using more capable AI models. User could opt-in when a complex visual would enhance understanding.

---

## Card Quality & AI

### Prompt Improvements
Ongoing refinement of the card generation prompt to produce higher quality, more effective flashcards.

### Faster/Fine-tuned Models
Use a faster, distilled model potentially fine-tuned specifically for question generation to improve speed and quality.

---

## Organization & Deck Management

### Tagging System
Tag cards for filtering, combining, or organizing across decks. Enable flexible card organization beyond simple deck hierarchy.

### Deck Management UI
Canvas-style interface for managing decks. Drag-and-drop cards between decks, view deck hierarchy, and start reviews from any level (reviewing all cards in a deck and its sub-decks).

### Smart Deck Assignment
In the browser extension, save cards to specific decks with intelligent inference about which deck the user likely wants based on context.

### Deck Sharing
Share decks publicly or with specific users. Enable collaborative learning and deck distribution.

### Card Embeddings & Knowledge Graph
Embed cards semantically to enable network/graph visualization of knowledge. Show relationships between concepts and identify gaps.

---

## Spaced Repetition Settings

### Algorithm Customization
Allow users to adjust parameters of the spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., ease factors, intervals, learning steps) to match their preferences.

---

## Platform Expansion

### Mobile App
Mobile version for practicing on phone. Consider native app for better performance and offline support.

### Offline Mode
Enable reviewing cards without an internet connection, syncing progress when back online.
